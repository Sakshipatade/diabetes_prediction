# diabetes_prediction
Machine Learning project to predict diabetes using diabetes.csv dataset

### Dataset
The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which can be downloaded from [Dropbox Link]:https://www.dropbox.com/s/uh7o7uyeghqkhoy/diabetes.csv?dl=0

### Features
  Data preprocessing and cleaning
  Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
  Model training using machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine)
  Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

### Requirements
  Python 3.x
  pandas
  numpy
  scikit-learn

  Install the requirements with:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
  Clone this repository.
  Download the dataset and place it in the project folder.
  Open diabetes_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
  Run all cells to train and test the model.

### Output
  The system will output the model's performance metrics and indicate whether a sample input is predicted as diabetic or not.
